# Idea
is to make a simple movie quiz app based on https://www.themoviedb.org/ API so it looks and runs smoothly, then (possibly) throw in some more cool features.

## Making the first screen
I was trying to make cool animations and transitions. I think it went well.

## Network Manager is now complete. 
Movies are generated from themoviedb popular movies. Each movie gets 3 similar to complicate a choice. When done, object is recorded to realm, so user can continue even if app was once closed. Each time realm object is updated UI will update automatically.
